# Lumi√®re E-Commerce

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

The project is a simple yet elegant and functional design of an E-Commerce shopping site.

## Technologies

The app's core technologies are React, Javascript, HTML and CSS.\
It uses additional external libraries such as Stripe API for payment processing, Jest for testing and react router for routing.

## Key Features

The app contains functions to manipulate the DOM based on dynamic states which are shared between different components of the app.\
The app is integrated with Stripe API to be able to process real-time payments.\
The app is fully responsive and maintains usage from mobile, tablets, PCs and more.\
The app is comprised of 3 main pages to provide the core components of an store:

- Home
- Catalog
- Cart

## Important Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the build folder to gh-pages branch and start up a page on github's domain.\
